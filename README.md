# ACL-CONFIGURATION-ON-VTY-LINES

Remote access via virtual terminal or virtual tty (vty) lines can also be secured by configuring inbound and outbound Access Control Lists (ACLs). Inbound ACLs enable inbound connections to a Cisco device, router or switch, from a restricted list of IP addresses. On the other hand, outbound ACLs controls outbound access from Cisco devices. The best practice is to allow internal or trusted network IP addresses to access the vty lines.
